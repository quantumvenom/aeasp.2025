\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{../../media/xkcdpython.png}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why Python?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item High level language: closer to human language than machine code
	
	\item Well documented and supported: \textbf{many} packages available via PyPI
	
	\item <2->Widely used in scientific computing
	
	\item <2->Completely free and open source

	\item <4->Not the best at anything, but good enough at everything
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% ======== Installing Anaconda =========

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Anaconda Distribution}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Python comes in \textbf{distributions}: specific implementations with packages
	
	\item Anaconda: widely used distribution for scientific computing
	
	\item <2->Automatically includes all of the most commonly used packages for scientific work
	
	\item <2->Has its own virtual environment and package manager, \texttt{conda}
	
	\item <3->Also comes with a pretty nice interactive development environment (IDE), Spyder
	
	\item <3->Spyder is set up for IPython: better graphical presentation
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Installing Anaconda}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Go to \texttt{https://www.anaconda.com/download}
	
	\item Submit your email or click ``skip registration''
	
	\item Select the distribution installer for your OS
	
	\item You probably want the graphical installer if it's an option
	
	\item Download it, then install Anaconda; this will take a bit
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% ======== Version control and collaboration: git =========

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Collaboration and Version Control with \texttt{git}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item You have done group work; probably shared docs by email or Dropbox
	
	\item Academic research is a really big group project: so many files
	
	\item <2->Multiple people working on same file at the same time: oh no!
	
	\item <2->Realize in November that you need some file how it looked back in May
	
	\item <3->Academic / programmer solution: version control via \texttt{git}
	
	\item <3->Track \texttt{entire} history of file changes, easy to revert to prior version
	
	\item <4->Make ``branches'' from main, can merge separate work paths via pull requests
	
	\item <4->Work on files locally, but long term archived on a remote server
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% ======== Getting a GitHub account =========

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Making \texttt{git} Easier: GitHub}
\begin{itemize}

	\item GitHub is a website and desktop app that provides an easier interface for \texttt{git}
	
	\item You can use command line \texttt{git}, but I will show you GitHub Desktop
	
	\item <2->Go to \texttt{https://github.com}, enter your email address and sign up
	
	\item <2->Everything you need for this course is on free tier, but you can pay for more
	
	\item <3->Next: Go to \texttt{https://github.com/apps/desktop} and install GitHub Desktop
	
	\item <3->Then open it and sign in to your GitHub account; only have to do this once
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


% ======== Forking the course repo =========

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What the Fork is a Repository?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A collection of files in \texttt{git} is called a repository (repo)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item All of your work for one academic project would be a repository
	
		\item The (non-Canvas) course website is a GitHub repository
	
		\item The development of a new Python package would happen in a repo
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item <2->GitHub repos can be \texttt{public} and available to everyone who finds it
	
	\item <2->Or can be \texttt{private} and only accessible to invited collaborators
	
	\item <3->A repo can be \textbf{forked}, making a new personal copy-- it can be private!
	
	\item <3->You can issue a \texttt{pull request} (PR) to send changes from your fork back to the ``upstream'' repo
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Forking the Course Repository}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Each of you will make a personal fork of the course repository
	
	\item You will submit assignments (etc) by issuing a PR back to the upstream repo
	
	\item Go to course website: \texttt{https://github.com/econ-ark/aeasp.2025}
	
	\item Click the menu arrow near ``Fork'' in top right, select ``Create a new fork''
	
	\item Default options should be fine; click green ``Create'' button	
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

% ======== Cloning the course repo =========

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Cloning Your Fork to Local Machine}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Repos (and forks) actually live on the remote GitHub server
	
	\item You must \textbf{clone} them to your computer to work with files
	
	\item Creates a local working copy of the repo (or your fork)
	
	\item Open GitHub Desktop and:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Click ``Repository'' button in top left
		
		\item Then ``Add'' and ``Clone repository...''
		
		\item Select \texttt{YourHandle/aeasp.2025}, probably only option
		
		\item Choose a local directory to put it in
	\end{enumerate}

	\item All of the course repo files are now on your computer!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% ======== Making commits and pull requests =========

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Where's the Remote? Making Commits}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Changes that you make to your local clone don't automatically go to remote
	
	\item Need to \textbf{commit} them: ``put a pin'' in changes, with (label and comments)
	
	\item <2->Easiest to show by example: open up \texttt{/materials/setup/Survey.txt}
	
	\item <2->Read the instructions, then fill out the short survey below
	
	\item <2->Save file as instructed in step (3) of the survey document; my survey is there
	
	\item <3->In GitHub Desktop, click on ``Changes''; name your commit, comments optional
	
	\item <3->Click ``commit to main'', then click ``push to remote'' at the top
	
	\item <3->Pushing to remote is what actually shares your local work with the server
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Where's the Remote? Making Pull Requests}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Navigate on \texttt{github.com} to your fork of the course repo
	
	\item Click on the ``1 commits'' button; the commit you just made should be there!
	
	\item <2->But I want your survey in the upstream course repo; need to make a \textbf{pull request}
	
	\item <2->PR: Request to merge ``downstream'' work into ``upstream'' project
	
	\item <3->At top left, click ``Pull requests'', then ``New pull request''
	
	\item <3->Ensure you're going from \texttt{YourHandle/aeasp.2025} to \texttt{Econ-ARK/aeasp.2025}
	
	\item <3->Give a title and descriptive comments to your PR, then create/submit it
	
	\item <4->Then we can see your PR(s) on the course repo!
