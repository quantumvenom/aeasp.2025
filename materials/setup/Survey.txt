AEA Summer Program Students: What Do They Know? Do They Know Things?? Let's Find Out!

This is a short survey to help your instructors find out what you already know.
The presence of something on the list below does not indicate that we expect you
to know anything about it, nor that we will teach anything about it.

Please read and follow the instructions carefully.

1) Immediately save a copy of this file as SurveyLASTNAMEII.txt, where LASTNAME
is your last (family) name and II is your first (and middle) initials. Capitalize normally.

2) For each item below the dashed line, change the numeral 0 to the most appropriate 
value according to the legend below. Please answer based on your state of knowledge
when you woke up on May 30, 2025. Do not make any other alterations.

3) Put your renamed file (with responses) in the /submissions/FirstDaySurvey/ directory
of your fork of the course repository.

4) Use GitHub Desktop to commit your added file to your fork.

5) Issue a pull request back to the main fork of the course repository.
